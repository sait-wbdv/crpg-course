title: "Git Version Control & HTML Syntax"
description: "Practice making git commits, writing html, and deploying a static web page"
---

Objective: The goal of this activity is to practice using git, writing html, and adding some styles to your html.

## Instructions

Create a git repository that includes the following files:

index.html
style.css
README.md
Instructions
Make at least 5 git commits as you add content to the page (1 for each file creation and than at least 2 more for content adding)
set up your html file using vscode's html:5&nbsp;shortcut
Link the stylesheet to the html page in the head
add a main tag to the index.html body
add an h1 tag with some text
add a paragraph with some more text (lorem ipsum is fine)
make a class for the h1 tag to change it's color
add marging and/or padding to the main tag
Deploy your web page using github pages (see the settings in your github repository)

Note that this doesn't need to be beautiful. We are simply making sure that we have a grasp of how git and html works as you'll need to be a little comfortable with this syntax for later assignments.

## Submission

- Add a link to your github repo and live github pages web page to the text box in your submission
- Get a zip folder of your repo from github and attach it to your submission
